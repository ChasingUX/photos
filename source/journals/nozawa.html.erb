We left feeling extreme levels of chill." }) %>

The people of Nozawa visit one of the 12 public natural hot spring baths, clean themselves - and carry on with their day. The bathhouses themselves are nothing fancy: 4 walls (actually, some are outdoors), a large tub with a spout, and buckets to rinse yourself with. The baths are rustic, natural and raw." }) %>

If I grew up visiting onsens often and was exposed to generations of natural female form (as opposed to what I saw in Cosmo, or what kids today see on Instagram models’ feeds), my image of what women ‘should’ look like would be entirely different. I believe my inclination towards superficial beauty standards may be more evenly balanced with acceptance of the natural form." }) %>

It’s amazing how 1 familiar(ish) food can provide so much comfort when everything else around you is foreign. These buns seriously hold a soft place in our hearts.
