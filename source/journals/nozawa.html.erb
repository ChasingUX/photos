If I grew up visiting onsens often and was exposed to generations of natural female form (as opposed to what I saw in Cosmo, or what kids today see on Instagram models’ feeds), my image of what women ‘should’ look like would be entirely different. I believe my inclination towards superficial beauty standards may be more evenly balanced with acceptance of the natural form." }) %>

It’s amazing how 1 familiar(ish) food can provide so much comfort when everything else around you feels foreign. These buns seriously hold a soft place in our hearts.
