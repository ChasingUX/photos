  <p>After an eye-opening first week in Kyoto, our plan was to do a deep loop into Nara and Wakayama prefecture, stopping first in Nara, and then visiting the smaller rural villages of Yoshino and Koyasan before completing the loop back up in Osaka. On the train ride from Kyoto to Nara, we prepared ourselves for a short, 3 day trip.</p>

  <p>At this point, we didn’t know much about Nara, outside of the deer park, the Buddhist temples, and the old post-town. We decided we are going to relax after a nonstop week, and take it slow in Nara. After all, the forecast was heavy rain, all day every day. So, we embrace! Our Airbnb host, Mickey, was waiting for us with a huge smile and a small car. We piled in with our luggage and quickly started chatting about Nara, his life, and our travels. Because we only had a few days, he offered to drop us off at the deer park, and gave us directions back to his apartment about a mile away.</p>

So I extended my arm, and a few sniffs later they made their interest in us known. So the next hour was spent laying on the group with deer, exchanging stories and having lots of laughs together. Like dogs, they were quite fond of scratching the hard-to-reach places, like where the antlers meet the head. Through this moment, we learned that when I am around animals, I enter a childlike state, where nothing matters but the joy of that very moment." }) %>

It was pouring rain outside, but like any Japanese would, we grabbed our oversized umbrellas and embarked on a 20 minute walk to Marugen. As we entered their doors, we weren’t met with smiles and welcoming gestures, rather looks of confusion. As if they had never welcomed a westerner before, we knew that MIckey had suggested a real-deal, local kind of spot. " }) %>

The flavors that I experienced were unlike any other bowl of soup I’ve eaten. Words won’t do it justice, so you’ll have to take my word that it was an insanely delicious bowl of Ramen.

The streets were lined with sake factories, handicraft shops, and tiny izakayas, all of which had so much subtle character. Paper thin sliding doors, ornate carvings, and dark wooden beams seemed present across every structure." }) %>

  <p>At one point I heard repetitive bursts of men yelling, so I made my way towards the noise, only to find the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmSrULDVRPc" target="blank">fastest mochi maker in Japan</a> pounding his mallet against a giant green mochi ball with his crew. On a side note, I ate a good bit of Mochi through our trip and ultimately grew quite disgusted by the sticky, doughie mouthfeel.</p>

I entered through the Noren, the traditional cloth barriers in front of a store and was greeted with a smile from a brewery employee. She sat me down and had me try 7 different types of sake they brewed. She suggested I try different types of pickles to clear my palate between tastings. It was here that I learned that sake is absolutely delicious and has widely varying flavor profiles. I took home my favorite of the bunch, a bottle of Sakura (Cherry Blossom) sake that Madi and I drank later that night, in bed. " }) %>
