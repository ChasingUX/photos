An architectural gem, built by Airbnb, and maintained by the Yoshino community. Each night you stay in the Yoshino house, a local hosts you. The first night, we were hosted by a 'Guardian of the Forest' named ___ who greeted us with a bottle of sake. We used Google Translate to communicate with him through an entire dinner. The house sleeps 5; we shared the space with guests from Mexico and Australia." }) %>
