<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "We visited Yoshino, a small lumber town outside of Osaka, for the Yoshino House. An architectural gem, built by Airbnb, and maintained by the Yoshino community. Each night you stay in the Yoshino house, a local hosts you. The first night, we were hosted by a 'Guardian of the Forest' named Akhimoto, who greeted us with a bottle of sake. We used Google Translate to communicate with him through an entire dinner. The house sleeps 5; we shared the space with guests from Mexico and Australia." }) %>

Light and shadow were highly considered, the house changed drastically from morning to night. The soft, warm wood created the coziest vibe - perfect for nights in, cooking dinner, sharing Sake and getting to know one another. " }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "In the evenings, we wandered to the local grocery store, picked up some groceries and made dinner for the house. We spent the nights around the communal table with dumplings, rice, soba noodles and lots of sake. After late nights with our roommates, we made our way upstairs. The ceilings were slanted in, forming a triangle. We rolled out our tatami mats (which were more comfortable than expected) and cuddled up. It felt like camp! We awoke with a sunrise view of the river." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "We made quick friends with Diego and Ana, honeymooners from Mexico who we met up with again in Osaka. The 4 of us biked around town aimlessly and discovered the cedar lumberyards that supplied the wood for the Yoshino House and a few local temples. Quiet, normal days like these ground us, a very needed sensation when traveling for such a long period." }) %>
