<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "We visited Yoshino, a small lumber town outside of Osaka, for the Yoshino House. An architectural gem, built by Airbnb, and maintained by the Yoshino community. Each night you stay in the Yoshino house, a local hosts you. The first night, we were hosted by a 'Guardian of the Forest' named Akhimoto, who greeted us with a bottle of sake. We used Google Translate to communicate with him through an entire dinner. The house sleeps 5; we shared the space with guests from Mexico and Australia." }) %>

Quiet, normal days like these ground us, a very needed sensation when traveling for such a long period." }) %>
