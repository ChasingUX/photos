It is only reachable by cablecar and is considered to be the center of Shingon Buddhism. We had heard remarkable stories about Koyasan from our friend Catherine, so we decided to take the trek to see what it was all about. This 2-day trip turned out to be the most magical part of Japan that we visited." }) %>

During our walk, it was extremely quiet, the rain pattering off the gravestones and pebbled ground. We remained silent, in complete awe of our surroundings. When we arrived at the monestary, we sat in silence, closed our eyes and listened to the monks chant." }) %>

We booked this place a few months in advance, excited to sleep in our own tiny pods, roughly 3x8x3 feet in size. Inside each elf-sized door was a mattress that extended from wall to wall. While it rained the entire time, seeking refuge inside these capsules was strangely cozy and warming. We were worried about the calustraphobic tendencies they might have, but instead we felt hugged by having our own tiny space.  " }) %>

As we walked through the town, visiting temples, and hiking through the woods, we had entered a state of tranquility and ease that we hadn't felt on our trip thus far." }) %>
