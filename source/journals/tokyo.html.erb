Our days are mostly stress free and we’re not accountable to any schedule. It’s easy to live in the present this way. We’re also on our travel A game. I’m astonished at how quickly one can adapt to a completely new and foreign lifestyle. Sleeping in a new bed each night, eating totally different food, not seeing any familiar faces - we’re surviving all of it." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "However, on our last week in Japan, we started getting really antsy to move on. There are certainly parts of Japanese culture that we don’t jive with. In general, there isn’t a lot of friendliness and sociability. We see people at dinner together playing games on their phones. We smile at people as we walk down the street and they look away or avoid eye contact all together. The overall level of formality in this country leads to a bit of uptightness, like they’re taking everything a bit too seriously. It was fascinating at first but isn’t exactly a personality fit with us. Our first dose of homesickness hits towards the end of our month in Japan.

The population of this neighborhood seemed to be about 80% Japanese men, 10% tourists and 10% women dressed up as sexy Anime characters. Maid Cafes (in which the waitresses serve you on their hands and knees and call you master) are everywhere. The fetish for schoolgirls is imbued in nearly all of the marketing - from ramen shops to convenience stores. I suspect many of these men have mostly interacted with women via video games. It certainly put a damper on the Akihabara experience, we felt really sad for the women working in this industry but also for the gamer men who seemed hypnotized by the misogynistic game plots and stories.
