Our days are mostly stress free and we’re not accountable to any schedule. It’s easy to live in the present this way.

Sleeping in a new bed each night, eating totally different food, not seeing any familiar faces - we’re surviving all of it." }) %>

The population of this neighborhood seemed to be about 80% Japanese men, 10% tourists and 10% women dressed up as sexy Anime characters. Maid Cafes (in which the waitresses serve you on their hands and knees and call you master) are everywhere. The fetish for schoolgirls is imbued in nearly all of the marketing - from ramen shops to convenience stores. We suspect many of these men have mostly interacted with women via video games. It certainly put a damper on the Akihabara experience, we felt really sad for the women working in this industry but also for the gamer men who seemed hypnotized by the misogynistic game plots and stories." }) %>

Our host, Yukari took us to a grocery store and introduced tons of new ingredients (tip: this would have been useful on week 1) then took us to her home cooking studio. First and foremost, we started sipping on the most delicious Yuzu Sake known to man. Then, we began prepping a meal of beef rice bowls, miso soup, Japanese omelet and green beans." }) %>

In general, we didn't experience much friendliness or sociability. We see people at dinner together playing games on their phones instead of connecting. We smile at people as we walk down the street and they look away or avoid eye contact all together. Our take is: the overall level of formality leads to a bit of stiffness. It was fascinating at first but isn’t exactly a personality fit with us. We felt a bit homesick and ready to move on. But all in all, living in Japan for 1 month was an eye-opening, odd in the most interesting ways and strangely fun experience.
