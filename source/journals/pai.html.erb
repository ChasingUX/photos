<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Pai was our place of rest on the Mae Hong Son Loop. Our 4 days here consisted of long breakfasts, coconut lattes, grungy outfits, dragonfruit smoothies, outdoor adventures - and avoiding the monsoon. The town itself is known to attract a hippie crowd in addition to the usual backpacker scene (as its only a 3 hour bus from Chiang Mai). For us, Pai was all about laying low and taking in Thailand's natural beauty." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Our Airbnb in Pai was a beautiful little artist's oasis. Our host, a painter, illustrator and coffee connoiseur built the structures himself. We spent the evenings (during the daily monsoon) watching hours of Friends, curled up in bed with Pad Thai and Mango Sticky Rice take-out. Not entirely different than what we'd do if it was rainy in SF. That little slice of home routine was so comforting, or cootzie as we'd call it." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "We spent the hours that it wasn't raining outside. Pai was the perfect mix of Thai countryside and the luxuries of a city (read: good coffee). We befriended the creatures of our neighborhood - we could see the cow (below) from our bed and the cat loitered feet from our doorstep. Not pictured: zillions of mosquitos. Jesse had 60 bites at once during this leg of the trip :( Luckily, we found an amazing Thai herbal remedy that helped with itching." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "A joyous experience for Jesse and a traumatizing one for Madi, the Pai Canyon was one we won't forget. Rich red soil cliffs dropped down hundreds of feet, creating narrow pathways (we're talking ~15in wide) to explore. The view from the ridges was gorgeous, a forest sprouting out from the canyon - so unlike the dry dessert canyons we see in the US. We climbed through crevases, hiked precarious ridges and came out alive!" }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Within a 20 min scooter ride of Pai, there is such diverse landscapes: the canyon, hot springs, waterfalls and a land split. Top that with massive shrines placed amongst this nature and you get a magical place to explore." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "The day we went to Sai Ngam hot springs was so restorative. Our bums and backs were sore from hours on the scooter and we were plauged with many mozzie bites. After talking a long, winding walk through the forest, we arrived at a flowing river with mini waterfalls along its path - the hot springs. The water temperature was absolutely perfect, like a bath. We found a nice little vine to lounge on and spent the next few hours so chilled out." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "The Land Split was like a mini Zion National Park. Ten years ago, a massive earthquake completely rocked the land, creating a crevass about 30 feet deep. The landowners property was destroyed. In an act of resillience, he turned it into an organic farm. He told us to sit and relax then brought us a plate with papaya, fresh tamarind, dried banana, hibiscus jam - he topped it off with homemade rosella wine. He shares the bounty of his farm for free, simply allowing guests to make a donation." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "We're so grateful for our time in Pai. The grueling and wild ride that was the Mae Hong Son wouldn't be as enjoyable without this little slice of heaven along the way. When we return to Thailand someday, Pai tops the list of places to return to. Next time we'll come when there's less mozzies." }) %>
