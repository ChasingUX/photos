We’d been planning our travels for over a year so there was certainly a weird “ok, now what?” feeling, followed by a “let’s freaking do this!” feeling. This city has a traditional Japanese vibe with outdoorsy twist. There’s the a bit of everything here - rolling residential hills, hipster back alleys, a bustling downtown, uppity department stores and of course, gorgeous temples swarming with tourists.

If the walk light is red and there isn’t a car in sight, the Japanese will all wait patiently at the light. It’s ingrained in all the little things.
