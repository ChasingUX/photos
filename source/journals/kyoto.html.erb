We’d been planning our travels for over a year so there was certainly a weird “ok, now what?” feeling, followed by a “let’s freaking do this!” feeling. After reading Murakami novels, we felt that Kyoto satisfied our expectations of beautiful winding residential alleys laiden with bamboo trees and mysterious cats. Kyoto has a traditional Japanese vibe with an outdoorsy twist. There’s the a bit of everything here - rolling residential hills, hipster back alleys, a bustling downtown, uppity department stores and of course, gorgeous temples swarming with tourists.

If the walk light is red and there isn’t a car in sight, the Japanese will typically  wait patiently at the light. It’s ingrained in all the little things.

As this was our first stop in Japan, we had little understading of which types of Japanese items we liked, let alone what was readily available in a given area. It was common for us to sit down and glance at an all-Japanese menu. We would attempt to translate it with Google, but a series of Japanese characters would usually result into something wildly wonky. Care for some, 'Octopus tree seahorse marigold' anyone? We would do out best to extrapolate the menu item based on certain key words, but we often failed. Eventually, we untangled the complex web of Japanese cuisine and knew what to look out for." }) %>

<section class="Wrapper Text">
  <p>We became obsessed with Teishoku (aka set meals), found at traditional Japanese restaurants. They come with 8-12 tiny plates of different foods (completely foreign to us). Lots of fermented items, tofu-based dishes, a miso soup, a rice and fish of some sort.</p>

  <p>Sushi conveyer belts were our best friend. The fish is high quality, super affordable and most importantly - you know exactly what you’re getting. Since menus are in English only about 50% of the time, a conveyer is a welcomed comfort. What you see is what you get!</p>
