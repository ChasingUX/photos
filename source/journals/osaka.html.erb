<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Our 5 half heavy rain, half perfect sunshine days in Osaka were absolutely wonderful. This was our first Japanese metropolis that felt like a real city. Getting off the subway felt like NYC, a tinge of welcomed Western familiarity. When we began this journey, we pondered: maybe someday we'll move to the country and have a big piece of land. This trip has crushed that dream and taught us that we are indeed, city people. We thrived in Osaka." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Osaka is considered the food capital of Japan. Dontunburi is considered the food capital of Osaka. A mile stretch of food stands and restaurants, each with a blinding neon advert. Hot tip: the restaurants that have gimmicks trying to lure you inside, are not the ones to try out. We had our best meal of the trip in Osaka. We were hangry AF, found a 5-star restaurant on FourSquare (the review app of choice). When we walked in, there was a vending machine (very common; you buy a ticket to give to the cooks) with no English so we frantically pressed some buttons and took our seat. We were treated to the richest, most savory pork ramens ___, all prepared in front of our eyes with fresh, unfamiliar ingredients. We have no clue what we ate, where this restaurant is or have any photo evidence - but for our #1 ranked meal, it feels right that way." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "We need to take a moment to honor the malls of Osaka (not pictured here, not much for the eyes). They put the Mall of America to absolute shame. They were city blocks wide, had their own transportation systems and Google Maps even routed you through them. The stores were also pretty incredible - would highly recommend bringing an empty suitcase to Osaka. The Umeda train station was also notable (cover photo, scroll up); it sprawled for miles. We often felt like salmon swimming up stream which was stressful but strangely exciting." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "____. ____. In Osaka, the streets regularly intersect 3 or 4 at a time. As a solution to long waits at multiple pedistrian lights, Osaka does this crazy thing where all the pedistrian lights go green at the same time and its just a mad rush to cross the streets in any which way. The picture above undersells the insanity. We had a ball getting caught up in the chaos." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Our favorite neighborhood: Nakazakicho. Man, was it cute. The shops are Japanese-sized, tiny litte things, probably 15 x 15 feet with such gems.
