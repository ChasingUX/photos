<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Our 5 half heavy rain, half perfect sunshine days in Osaka were absolutely wonderful. This was our first Japanese metropolis that felt like a real city. Getting off the subway felt like NYC, a tinge of welcomed Western familiarity. When we began this journey, we pondered: maybe someday we'll move to the country and have a big piece of land. This trip has crushed that dream and taught us that we are indeed, city people. We thrived in Osaka." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Osaka is considered the food capital of Japan. Dontunburi is considered the food capital of Osaka. A mile stretch of food stands and restaurants, each with a blinding neon advert. Hot tip: the restaurants that have gimmicks trying to lure you inside, are not the ones to try out. We had our best meal of the trip in Osaka. We were hangry AF, found a 5-star restaurant on FourSquare (the review app of choice). When we walked in, there was a vending machine (very common; you buy a ticket to give to the cooks) with no English so we frantically pressed some buttons and took our seat. We were treated to the richest, most savory pork ramens, all prepared in front of our eyes with fresh, unfamiliar ingredients. We have no clue what we ate, where this restaurant is or have any photo evidence - the mystery is part of the what makes the memory so special." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "We need to take a moment to honor the malls of Osaka (not pictured here, not much for the eyes). They put the Mall of America to absolute shame. They were city blocks wide, had their own transportation systems and Google Maps even routed you through them. The stores were also pretty incredible - would highly recommend bringing an empty suitcase to Osaka. The Umeda train station was also notable; it sprawled for miles. We often felt like salmon swimming up stream which was stressful but strangely exciting." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "In Osaka, the streets regularly intersect 3 or 4 at a time. As a solution to long waits at multiple pedistrian lights, Osaka does this crazy thing where all the pedistrian lights go green at the same time and its just a mad rush to cross the streets in any which way. The picture above undersells the insanity. We had a ball getting caught up in the chaos." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Our favorite neighborhood: Nakazakicho. Man, was it cute! The shops are Japanese-sized, tiny litte things, probably 15 x 15 feet with such gems. Our suitcases were still too full (we soon shipped a box home); not shopping was so painful. This neighborhood is off the beaten path for tourists, so we got a glimpse into the life of real Osakans on this day trip." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Like much of Japan, Osaka has the neon flashiness strangely combined with traditional features - think a gigantic plastic crab hovering above you (above, obviously) as a polite, aproned woman serves you warm tea, ever so gently. At this point, the oddness of it all began to feel normal." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Another favorite place in Osaka: Orange street. This was the home of trendy, upscale boutiques, hipster-y coffee shops and very well dressed Japanese folks. Our Airbnb was just a few minutes walk from here so we frequented the restaurants and shops on Orange. A recommendation: Biotop, a rooftop Italian place with pizzas. It's not the best pizza in the world, but when you haven't had pizza in 3 weeks - it hits the spot! " }) %>

<%= partial(:subheader, :locals => { :copy => "The Kobe Zoo." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Wow. We're not sure if this qualifies as an actual zoo. It's more like a zoo in which all the animals are in the same cage - and you're in there too. We saw monkeys interacting with flamingos, flamingos sharing a pong with deer - and so, so many beautiful birds. We arrived grumpy and this day turned into one of of pure, unadulterated joy. " }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Let's start with the birds. The photo on the right does a good job of illustrating what the interactions with the birds were like. Massive, magnificant birds were flying overhead (sometimes extremely close) and little ones scurried amongst your feet. We could feed and play with these little guys. It was Jesse paradise." }) %>

"}) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "The bird life was extremely diverse. We saw mice-eating hawks, colorful tropical parrots, mallard-looking ducks with beautiful coloring and our favorite - the ones that had legs like toothpicks. The best part was these birds were used to humans so they let us get up close and personal, unlike any interactions we'd ever had with birds." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "The lemurs were by far the most-entertaining, rowdiest of the zoo. They'd zip around, running between your legs, jumping over your head, terrifying the children, etc, etc. " }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Much of the visit to this zoo was spent with Jesse on the floor, amongst the animals. Per usual, the flocked to him. If Madison left him alone for even a minute, somehow the creatures would swarm him. This may remind you of the deer in Nara or the cat cafe in Tokyo, it's certainly a trend." }) %>
