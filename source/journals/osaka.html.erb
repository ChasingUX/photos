This was our first Japanese metropolis that felt like a real city. Getting off the subway felt like NYC, a tinge of welcomed Western familiarity. When we began this journey, we pondered: maybe someday we'll move to the country and have a big piece of land. This trip has crushed that dream and taught us that we are indeed, city people. We thrived in Osaka." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "We need to take a moment to honor the malls of Osaka (not pictured here, not much for the eyes). They put the Mall of America to absolute shame. They were city blocks wide, had their own transportation systems and Google Maps even routed you through them. The stores were also pretty incredible - would highly recommend bringing an empty suitcase to Osaka. The Umeda train station was also notable (cover photo, scroll up); it sprawled for miles. We often felt like salmon swimming up stream." }) %>
