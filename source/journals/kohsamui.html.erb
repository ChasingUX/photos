Not only was our villa epic, Koh Samui itself is absolutely gorgeous. Teal waters, rocky coastlines and blue skies all day, everyday. Prepare to see a lot of beautiful, bright blues and greens in the photos - that gives an accurate depiction of the real Koh Samui." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Villa Baan Jasmine was a gift from heaven. We had our own pool, a hammock, huge comfy couch and - a kitchen! We hadn't had a real kitchen in 2 months at this point so this was a massive win for us. We spent the evenings watching movies on a TV (!) in the living room (!) as opposed to huddled over an iPad in bed. After living in small Airbnbs, the basics of a home felt so luxurious. We spent most of our week here in our beautiful villa taking in the sunshine, hanging at the pool and cooking." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Right down the road was an epic market for the locals. We stocked up. For 300 baht aka $9 we got: fresh tofu, rice noodles, homemade curry paste, fresh coconut milk, 2 coconuts, 4 passionfruits, 4 zucchini, 1 papaya, a head of broccoli, a head of cauliflower, snap peas, thai red chilis, garlic, limes, baby eggplants and tons of thai basil. What a dream! We made a way-too-hot veggie-packed batch of Thai curry which we ate for days and couldn't have been happier." }) %>

We were a short scooter ride away from the town of Koh Samui that had plenty of restaurants, markets and shops - largely targeted to tourists." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "When you think of the act of traveling, you think of stinky airplanes and long lines. The experience of getting to Koh Samui was half grueling, half refreshing. We took a 45 min plane in Chiang Mai to the Koh Samui airport, then a 3 hour van ride through the Thai jungle and finally to the last leg - an hour long boat ride, which was absolutely incredible. The boat zig zagged between little islands along the east coast of Thailand.  Once we got there, the scooter was our main mode of transport (per usual). We spent lots of time zipping around the island." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Right off the main drag, a dusty, busy, obnoxious touristy street lays a hidden gem. We got off our scooter very skeptical but as soon as we were beyond the big doors of The Page, everything changed. It opened up to beautiful grounds, a red pool and a gorgeous restaurant - all in the style of a modern art museum. We sipped cocktails beachside then took a swim in the warmest, calmest waters. It was a few hours of absolute bliss." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "The Page is definitely a bit more lux than our normal jaunts. We had just spent weeks riding our scooter across the country, stopping in at dives and eating street food. We needed this upgrade so badly. We soaked it all up. Relatively to USD, it was still quite cheap to hang around The Page." }) %>
