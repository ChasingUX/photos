Not only was our villa epic, Koh Samui itself is absolutely gorgeous. Teal waters, rocky coastlines and blue skies all day, everyday. Prepare to see a lot of beautiful, bright blues and greens in the photos - that gives an accurate depiction of the real Koh Samui." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Villa Baan Jasmine was a gift from heaven. We had our own pool, a hammock, huge comfy couch and - a kitchen! We hadn't had a real kitchen in 2 months at this point so this was a massive win for us. We spent the evenings watching movies on a TV (!) in the living room (!) as opposed to huddled over an iPad in bed. After living in small Airbnbs, the basics of a home felt so luxurious. We spent most of our week here in our beautiful villa taking in the sunshine, hanging at the pool and cooking." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Right down the road was an epic market for the locals. We stocked up. For 300 baht aka $9 we got: fresh tofu, rice noodles, homemade curry paste, fresh coconut milk, 2 coconuts, 4 passionfruits, 4 zucchini, 1 papaya, a head of broccoli, a head of cauliflower, snap peas, thai red chilis, garlic, limes, baby eggplants and tons of thai basil. What a dream! We made a way-too-hot veggie-packed batch of Thai curry which we ate for days and couldn't have been happier." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "When you think of the act of traveling, you think of stinky airplanes and long lines. The experience of getting to Koh Samui was half grueling, half refreshing. We took a 45 min plane in Chiang Mai to the XYZ airport, then a 3 hour van ride through the Thai jungle and finally to the last leg - an hour long boat ride, which was absolutely incredible. The boat zig zagged between little islands, ___.  Once we got there, the scooter was our main mode of transport (per usual). We spent lots of time zipping around the island." }) %>

<%= partial(:text_one_col, :locals => { :copy => "Right off the main drag, a dusty, busy, obnoxious touristy street lays a hidden gem. We got off our scooter very skeptical but as soon as we were beyond the big doors of The Page, everything changed. It opened up to beautiful grounds, a red pool and a gorgeous restaurant - all in the style of a modern art museum. We sipped cocktails beachside then took a swim in the warmest, calmest waters. It was a few hours of absolute bliss." }) %>

Relatively to USD, it was still quite cheap to hang around The Page." }) %>
