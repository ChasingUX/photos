This adjustment felt quite smooth as Thailand is much more laid-back, friendly and tourist-friendly. The Thai are so warm and kind. Not only to us, but we often seen waitresses hugging each other, dudes with their arms around each other - and just so much laughter and playfulness. Iâ€™m not sure if tourism became huge here because of this warmth or vice versa. Either way, it was a welcomed change.

To put it simply, it's a hot, spicy soup slash chicken curry. There's a crazy combo of textures: fried noodles, thick coconut broth and rice noodles. It's all topped with slow-cooked, fall-off-the-bone chicken drumsticks. We'll be seeking this out in SF with voracity." }) %>
