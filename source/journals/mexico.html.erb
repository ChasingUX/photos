Chris, wanting to be a hero, jumped out of the en route cab and sprinted south. The restaurant was north but by the time we yelled down the street, he was a trail of dust. Then, Jesse bailed, running north. The Oie girls stayed, screaming and laughing in a tizzy. Like magic, the 3 parties converged on Pujol at 8:15, the minute we were due at the restaurant. 

We arrived to this beautiful, spa-like atmosphere sweating and in a panic. Salud!
